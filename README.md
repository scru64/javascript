SCRU64 ID offers compact, time-ordered unique identifiers generated by
distributed nodes. SCRU64 has the following features:

- ~62-bit non-negative integer storable as signed/unsigned 64-bit integer
- Sortable by generation time (as integer and as text)
- 12-digit case-insensitive textual representation (Base36)
- ~38-bit Unix epoch-based timestamp that ensures useful life until year 4261
- Variable-length node/machine ID and counter fields that share 24 bits

```javascript
// pass node ID through global variable
globalThis.SCRU64_NODE_SPEC = "42/8";

import { scru64Sync, scru64StringSync } from "scru64";
// or on browsers:
// import { scru64Sync, scru64StringSync } from "https://unpkg.com/scru64@^0.2";

// generate a new identifier object
const x = scru64Sync();
console.log(String(x)); // e.g., "0u2r85hm2pt3"
console.log(x.toBigInt()); // as a 64-bit unsigned integer

// generate a textual representation directly
console.log(scru64StringSync()); // e.g., "0u2r85hm2pt4"
```

See [SCRU64 Specification] for details.

SCRU64's uniqueness is realm-specific, i.e., dependent on the centralized
assignment of node ID to each generator. If you need decentralized, globally
unique time-ordered identifiers, consider [SCRU128].
